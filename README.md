About the Project

This API provides the core functionality for a learning management system where users can enroll in courses, manage their learning progress, and potentially make payments (depending on the implementation). It's built with FastAPI, a popular Python framework for building APIs.

Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories, each with a specific purpose:

app - Contains the core application logic for the API.
init.py - Initialization script for the application.
main.py - FastAPI application entry point.
config.py - Configuration file for settings and API keys.
database.py - Connection logic for the chosen database (likely PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy).
models.py - Definition of SQLAlchemy models for data representation.
schemas.py - Pydantic schemas used for data validation in requests and responses.
payments.py - Handles payment processing (integration with Stripe or other providers).
utils.py - Utility functions for common tasks like password hashing and token generation.
exceptions.py - Custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios.
security.py - Security-related functions (authentication, authorization).
services - Business logic layer used by routes and CRUD operations.
init.py - Initialization script for the services directory.
Service files define business logic for specific functionalities (e.g., course_service.py, enrollment_service.py, payment_service.py).
crud - Contains implementation for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on various models.
init.py - Initialization script for the CRUD directory.
CRUD files define functions for specific models (e.g., course.py, enrollment.py, payment.py, user.py, admin.py).
routes - Contains definition of API routes for interacting with the application.
init.py - Initialization script for the routes directory.
Route files map API endpoints to specific functionalities of the application (e.g., course.py, enrollment.py, payment.py, auth.py, admin.py).
tests - Contains unit tests for the application logic and functionality.
init.py - Initialization script for the tests directory.
Test files cover various functionalities based on model/service/route (e.g., test_course.py, test_enrollment.py, etc.).
test_security.py - Tests for security-related features.
migrations - Manages database schema migrations (likely using Alembic for PostgreSQL).
versions - Directory containing versioned migration files.
env.py - Alembic environment configuration file.
